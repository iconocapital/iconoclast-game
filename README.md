## What Is This?

**Iconoclast: Find Your Guide** is a browser-based retro RPG built by [Iconoclastic Capital](https://iconocapital.com) — a fee-only fiduciary financial planning firm based in New York.

Instead of boring brochures, we made a game. Because if financial advice is going to be different, the way you discover it should be too.

You play as someone navigating the real obstacles between you and financial clarity:

| Zone | What You Face |
|------|--------------|
| 🏘️ **Uncertainville** | The overwhelm of not knowing where to start |
| 📺 **Media Swamp** | Scary headlines designed to make you panic |
| 🌲 **Opinion Forest** | Everyone's unsolicited financial advice |
| ⛰️ **Worry Mountains** | Your own doubts and fears about money |
| 🧙 **The Iconoclastic Guide** | The clarity you've been looking for |

At the end, you meet The Iconoclastic Guide — a wizard who actually listens, reflects your journey back to you, and asks what *you* need. No sales pitch. Just a real conversation.

## Why a Game?

Most people avoid financial planning because it feels intimidating, confusing, or boring. We wanted to flip that.

**Iconoclast: Find Your Guide** uses interactive storytelling and behavioral finance concepts to help people recognize the real barriers to getting financial help — and realize they don't have to face them alone.

It's also a playable demonstration of what makes Iconoclastic Capital different:

- **Fee-only** — no commissions, no kickbacks, no conflicts of interest
- **Fiduciary** — legally required to put your interests first
- **Human** — we talk like real people, not compliance robots
